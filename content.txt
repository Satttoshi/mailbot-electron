Hi,

I'm David, and I work as a manager at Artlook Studios, a company offers photo and video editing services. We have big Ukrainian team. Our main office is located in Brooklyn, NY.

Our skilled and dedicated team pours their heart and soul into each project to ensure the utmost satisfaction of our valued clients. When you choose to collaborate with us, you'll quickly witness the level of commitment and artistry we bring to the table.

We have the privilege of partnering with professional photographers and videographers. Our editors possess a wealth of experience across a diverse range of creative fields. From the magic of weddings to the beauty of portraits, the tenderness of maternity sessions, the allure of boudoir, the energy of bar/bat mitzvahs, and the vibrancy of sweet sixteen celebrations, we infuse each project with our expertise and dedication. We're also well-versed in handling travel photography, real estate images, and a wide variety of other visual content.

To ensure the highest quality, our editors have a wealth of experience, and we implement a two-step checking process. First, the project is reviewed by our team lead, and then it undergoes a second check by my assistant to confirm that the editor followed your style and requests. We harness the power of cutting-edge tools, utilizing the latest versions of Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere. These resources enable us to refine various types of videos and photos, with a special emphasis on the enchantment of weddings.

Our reach extends beyond borders, as we proudly serve clients in the USA, New Zealand, Canada, England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and many more locations. Language is no barrier for our talented editors, making us a truly international creative force.

If you ever find yourself in need of expert assistance in photo or video editing, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to transform your visions into captivating realities.

Warmest regards,

David
Manager at Artlook Studios
